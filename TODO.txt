Everything (no really)

In Tweet, Change pointers to a better pointer such as shared pointers so you don't worry as much about dereferencing garbage. 
In Tweet, Change likes to vector of who liked it.

In User, Implement Everything

Make a psudo simple database class.
    This will be a way to access all users and all tweets (could implement more but just for now, have it be super simple)

Goal is to have independent users be able to follow other users and interact with tweets.
